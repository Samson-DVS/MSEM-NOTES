**Lesson 1: Introduction to Project Management**
  - Project: Temporary endeavor for unique product/service/result; involves stakeholders, tradeoffs (scope, schedule, quality, resources, cost, risks).
  - PM Processes: Initiate, Plan, Execute, Monitor/Control, Close.
  - PMBOK Knowledge Areas (9): Integration, Scope, Time, Cost, Quality, HR, Communications, Risk, Procurement, Stakeholder.
  - Projects vs. Operations: Projects are temporary/unique; operations are ongoing/repetitive.
  - Soft Skills (communication, leadership) vs. Hard Skills (risk analysis, scheduling).
  - Project Life Cycle (PLC): Selecting/Initiating, Planning, Executing, Closing/Realizing.
  - Success Factors: Resources, time, clear expectations. Failure: Scope creep, unclear expectations, poor planning.
  - Roles: Sponsor (charters, mentors), Project Manager (accountable for results), Functional Manager (department head).
  - Organizational Structures: Functional (clear authority, slow communication), Projectized (PM has full authority, reduced barriers), Matrix (shared authority, flexible but conflicting bosses).

- **Lesson 2: Project Selection and Prioritization**
  - Strategic Planning: SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats); Vision/Mission (core purpose/values); SMART Objectives (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Results-based, Time-specific).
  - Portfolio Management: Aligns projects/programs/subprojects with strategy; balances risk/size/timing.
  - Identifying Projects: Business case, statement of work; consider value, demands, resources, support, goals.
  - Selection Methods: Financial (NPV: Discounted benefits - costs; BCR: Benefits/Costs >1; IRR: % return > cost of capital; Payback Period: Time to recover investment) vs. Scoring Models (criteria weighting, sensitivity analysis).
  - Prioritization: Urgency, benefits delay cost, timing details.
  - Strengths/Weaknesses: Financial models ensure ROI but ignore strategy; Scoring models align with goals but subjective.

- **Lesson 3: Chartering Projects**
  - Charter: Informal contract authorizing PM; transitions initiating to planning; creates commitment, screens poor projects.
  - Elements: Scope Overview (high-level what/how, prevents creep), Business Case (why, ties to strategy), Background (details), Milestone Schedule (key points, acceptance criteria), Risks/Assumptions/Constraints (identify, quantify, owner for major risks), Resources (budget estimates), Stakeholder List, Team Operating Principles (e.g., meetings, decisions), Lessons Learned (from past projects), Signatures (commitment).
  - Construction: Start with deliverables, work backward; use 6 steps for milestones.
  - Ratification: Sponsor approves; living document for changes.

- **Lesson 4: Stakeholder Analysis and Communication Planning**
  - Identify Stakeholders: Who affects/is affected (internal/external); brainstorm, group.
  - Analyze: Power/Interest Matrix (Keep Satisfied: High power/low interest; Manage Closely: High both; Monitor: Low both; Keep Informed: Low power/high interest); Prioritize by interest/influence/impact/urgency/legitimacy.
  - Document: Stakeholder Register (name, role, expectations, strategy).
  - Manage Engagement: Build relationships (trust, respect); Engagement Assessment Matrix (C=Current, D=Desired: Unaware/Resistant/Neutral/Supportive/Leading).
  - Communications Plan: Matrix (who/what/when/method); Purposes (cooperation, harmony); Considerations (stakeholder needs, tech, culture).
  - Meetings: PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act); Agenda/Minutes; Issues Log; Plus-Delta Evaluation.
  - Virtual/Global Teams: Challenges (time zones, culture); Preferences (e.g., high-context cultures like Japan prefer indirect comms); Tech (compatible, facilitating).
  - Knowledge Management: Lessons learned base.

- **Lesson 5: Scope Planning**
  - Scope Management: All work (and only that) to create deliverables; Processes: Plan, Define, Create WBS, Verify, Control.
  - Collecting Requirements: Iterative; Methods (interviews, focus groups, surveys, observation).
  - Scope Management Plan: How to define/verify/control.
  - Project Scope Statement: Evolves from charter; clearer over time.
  - WBS: Deliverable-oriented hierarchy; Formats (outline, org chart, free); Steps (major deliverables → smaller → right size → review); Basis for schedule/cost/risk.
  - Verification: Formal acceptance; Minimize creep (e.g., poor input leads to failures like McDonald's intranet).
  - Control: Influence changes, process via integrated change control; Variance (planned vs. actual).
  - Improving Input: User involvement, regular sign-offs, prototypes.

- **Lesson 6: Scheduling Projects**
  - Processes: Activity Definition (from WBS, list with attributes/milestones), Sequencing (dependencies: FS/FF/SS/SF; leads/lags), Resource Estimating (quantity/type, difficulty/history/availability), Duration Estimating (effort ≠ duration; expert input), Schedule Development (Gantt, CPM, PERT), Control (reality checks, contingencies).
  - Milestones: Significant events (no duration); Work backward from deliverables.
  - Errors: Forgotten tasks/assumptions, control processes (e.g., timesheets, meetings).
  - CPM: Longest path (critical); Slack/Float (delay without impact); Two-Pass (forward/backward for early/late dates); Trade-offs (free/total slack).
  - Shortening: Crashing (add resources, least cost), Fast Tracking (parallel activities, more risk).
  - PERT: 3 estimates (Optimistic + 4xMost Likely + Pessimistic)/6; Accounts for variability.

- **Lesson 7: Resourcing Projects**
  - HR Plan: Identify/Acquire resources, timing (onboard/motivate/release).
  - Estimate Needs: Types/skills, constraints.
  - Identify Resources: Functions/discipline/skill/location/unit; Availability (full/part-time, internal/external).
  - Assign: RACI Chart (Responsible/Accountable/Consult/Inform); Gantt with names.
  - Overloads: Reorder, add resources, reduce scope/extend, level (delay non-critical by slack).
  - Compress Schedule: Crashing (critical path, least $/day); Fast Tracking (overlap, riskier).
  - Behavioral: Select/motivate team, handle diversity/virtual.
  - Tradeoffs: Precedence, limitations, skills, costs.

### **Key Terms & Definitions (Flashcard-Ready)**
- Project: Temporary, unique; creates product/service/result.
- Stakeholder: Affects/affected by project.
- PMBOK Process Groups: Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring/Controlling, Closing.
- Knowledge Areas: 10 (add Stakeholder to 9 in Lesson 1).
- SWOT: Strengths/Weaknesses (internal), Opportunities/Threats (external).
- NPV/BCR/IRR/PP: Financial selection tools.
