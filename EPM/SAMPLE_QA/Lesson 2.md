# Lesson 2: Project Selection and Prioritization â€“ Question Bank
---

## SECTION 1: Strategic Planning and Analysis (SWOT and Overall Process)

### Q1: What is the primary purpose of conducting a SWOT analysis during strategic planning for projects?

- **A)** To allocate resources to ongoing operations
- **B)** To evaluate internal strengths and weaknesses, and external opportunities and threats
- **C)** To create detailed project schedules
- **D)** To finalize project budgets

**Correct Answer**: B

**Explanation**: SWOT analysis helps identify internal (Strengths, Weaknesses) and external (Opportunities, Threats) factors to inform strategic decisions and project selection (Lesson 2, Page 4). This tool ensures projects leverage strengths and mitigate threats, aligning with organizational goals. A is incorrect (operations focus), C relates to scheduling (Lesson 6), and D is cost management (Lesson 7).

---

### Q2: In a SWOT analysis for a new software development project, "strong in-house IT team" would be classified as:

- **A)** A Threat
- **B)** An Opportunity
- **C)** A Strength
- **D)** A Weakness

**Correct Answer**: C

**Explanation**: Strengths are internal positive factors under the team's control, like skilled resources (Lesson 2, Page 4). Threats/Opportunities are external, and Weaknesses are internal negatives. This helps prioritize projects that build on internal advantages.

---

### Q3: Which element of strategic planning involves creating a vision statement to describe the organization's future state?

- **A)** SWOT analysis
- **B)** Guiding principles
- **C)** Portfolio management
- **D)** Financial modeling

**Correct Answer**: B

**Explanation**: Guiding principles include vision (future organization) and mission statements to achieve strategic goals (Lesson 2, Page 6). SWOT (A) is analysis, Portfolio (C) aligns projects, and Financial modeling (D) is selection.

---

## SECTION 2: Guiding Principles (Vision, Mission, and SMART Objectives)

### Q4: A mission statement should include which of the following elements?

- **A)** Only short-term financial targets
- **B)** Core purpose, values, primary business areas, and customers
- **C)** Detailed project timelines
- **D)** Resource allocation details

**Correct Answer**: B

**Explanation**: Mission statements outline the organization's core purpose, values, beliefs, culture, primary business, and customers to guide project selection (Lesson 2, Pages 6-8). C and D are part of planning (Lessons 3-7), and A is too narrow.

---

### Q5: Which SMART objective component ensures the goal is realistic and feasible given constraints?

- **A)** Specific
- **B)** Measurable
- **C)** Achievable
- **D)** Time-specific

**Correct Answer**: C

**Explanation**: Achievable ensures the objective is realistic based on resources and constraints (Lesson 2, Page 10). Specific defines what, Measurable tracks progress, and Time-specific sets deadlines.

---

### Q6: "Increase market share by 15% in the next fiscal year through targeted marketing" is a SMART objective because it is:

- **A)** Vague and unmeasurable
- **B)** Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Results-based, Time-specific
- **C)** Focused only on operations
- **D)** Lacking a business case

**Correct Answer**: B

**Explanation**: It meets all SMART criteria: Specific (increase market share via marketing), Measurable (15%), Achievable (realistic), Results-based (market growth), Time-specific (next fiscal year) (Lesson 2, Pages 10-11). C is operations, not projects, and D is unrelated.

---

## SECTION 3: Portfolio Management (Portfolios, Programs, Projects/Subprojects)

### Q7: Portfolio management seeks to balance projects by considering:

- **A)** Only high-risk, high-reward initiatives
- **B)** Large/small, high/low risk, and quick/long-term projects
- **C)** Operational work exclusively
- **D)** Subprojects without strategic alignment

**Correct Answer**: B

**Explanation**: Portfolios balance various project types (size, risk, duration) to achieve strategic objectives (Lesson 2, Page 15). A is imbalanced, C is operations, and D ignores strategy.

---

### Q8: A program differs from a portfolio because a program:

- **A)** Includes unrelated projects and operations
- **B)** Manages a group of related projects for benefits not achievable individually
- **C)** Focuses on a single temporary project
- **D)** Lasts indefinitely like operations

**Correct Answer**: B

**Explanation**: Programs coordinate related projects for enhanced benefits (Lesson 2, Page 16). Portfolios (A) may include unrelated elements, projects (C) are single, and operations (D) are ongoing.

---

### Q9: What is a subproject?

- **A)** A standalone operational task
- **B)** A smaller portion of a larger project for manageability
- **C)** An entire portfolio of programs
- **D)** A long-term strategic objective

**Correct Answer**: B

**Explanation**: Subprojects break down large projects into manageable pieces (Lesson 2, Page 17). A is operations, C is portfolio, and D is an objective.

---

## SECTION 4: Identifying Potential Projects

### Q10: When identifying potential projects, organizations should aim to identify:

- **A)** Exactly the number of projects they can resource
- **B)** Twice as many projects as they can handle, for selection
- **C)** Only projects with detailed charters
- **D)** Projects without stakeholder input

**Correct Answer**: B

**Explanation**: Identifying twice the projects allows for better selection and prioritization (Lesson 2, Page 18). A limits options, C is later (Lesson 3), and D ignores stakeholders (Lesson 4).

---

### Q11: A business case for a project primarily describes:

- **A)** The narrative of products/services to be provided
- **B)** Why the project is important from a business standpoint
- **C)** Detailed resource estimates
- **D)** Risk response plans

**Correct Answer**: B

**Explanation**: The business case justifies the project with business value and rationale (Lesson 2, Page 19). A is statement of work, C is resourcing (Lesson 7), and D is risk management (Lesson 3).

---

### Q12: Key questions for identifying projects include: "Are the resources needed available?" and:

- **A)** "What is the final project deliverable?"
- **B)** "Is there enthusiastic support from customers or champions?"
- **C)** "What is the exact schedule?"
- **D)** "Who will manage risks?"

**Correct Answer**: B

**Explanation**: Identification considers resources, support, value, demands, and goals (Lesson 2, Page 21). A, C, and D are planning/chartering (Lessons 3-6).

---

## SECTION 5: Project Selection Methods (Financial Models)

### Q13: Net Present Value (NPV) is positive when:

- **A)** Discounted costs exceed benefits
- **B)** The project is expected to generate profit after discounting future values
- **C)** Payback period is longer than desired
- **D)** Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is zero

**Correct Answer**: B

**Explanation**: NPV > 0 indicates profitability after subtracting discounted costs from benefits (Lesson 2, Page 23). A is negative NPV, C is payback, and D is IRR.

---

### Q14: Which financial model measures the time to recover the initial investment?

- **A)** NPV
- **B)** BCR
- **C)** IRR
- **D)** Payback Period

**Correct Answer**: D

**Explanation**: Payback Period calculates recovery time; shorter is better (Lesson 2, Page 25). NPV discounts values, BCR is ratio, IRR is % return.

---

### Q15: A weakness of financial models in project selection is:

- **A)** They are too subjective
- **B)** They do not account for strategic goals
- **C)** They require no data
- **D)** They always favor short-term projects

**Correct Answer**: B

**Explanation**: Financial models ensure ROI but ignore non-financial strategy (Lesson 2, Page 25). A is scoring models' weakness, C is false, and D is partial (e.g., Payback favors short-term).

---

## SECTION 6: Project Selection Methods (Scoring Models)

### Q16: Scoring models for project selection involve:

- **A)** Only financial calculations like IRR
- **B)** Weighting criteria such as strategic alignment and risk
- **C)** Ignoring sensitivity analysis
- **D)** Focusing solely on cost savings

**Correct Answer**: B

**Explanation**: Scoring models use weighted criteria (e.g., goals, risk) for multi-factor evaluation (Lesson 2, Page 27). A is financial, C is incorrect (sensitivity is part), and D is too narrow.

---

### Q17: In a scoring model, mandatory criteria are:

- **A)** Optional factors that can be ignored
- **B)** Requirements that must be met for project consideration
- **C)** Only financial thresholds
- **D)** Post-selection adjustments

**Correct Answer**: B

**Explanation**: Mandatory criteria are non-negotiable (e.g., regulatory compliance) (Lesson 2, Page 27). A is false, C limits to financial, and D is prioritization.

---

### Q18: An advantage of scoring models over financial models is:

- **A)** They are purely objective
- **B)** They better align projects with organizational goals
- **C)** They require less data
- **D)** They focus only on short-term ROI

**Correct Answer**: B

**Explanation**: Scoring models incorporate strategy, unlike financial models (Lesson 2, Page 22). A is false (subjective weighting), C is untrue, and D is financial focus.

---

## SECTION 7: Prioritization and Sensitivity Analysis

### Q19: Project prioritization considers urgency, cost of delaying benefits, and:

- **A)** Detailed risk responses
- **B)** Practical timing details
- **C)** Final acceptance criteria
- **D)** Team operating principles

**Correct Answer**: B

**Explanation**: Prioritization uses urgency, benefit delays, and timing (Lesson 2, Page 33). A, C, and D are chartering (Lesson 3).

---

### Q20: Sensitivity analysis in project selection is used to:

- **A)** Ignore missing criteria
- **B)** Test how changes in factors affect decisions
- **C)** Calculate exact NPV
- **D)** Balance portfolios without review

**Correct Answer**: B

**Explanation**: Sensitivity analysis revises models for new/changed criteria (Lesson 2, Page 31). A is false, C is financial, and D is portfolio management.

---

### Q21: When prioritizing projects, scoring models provide input, but other factors include:

- **A)** Only financial ROI
- **B)** Cost of delaying expected benefits
- **C)** Ignoring project urgency
- **D)** Detailed WBS creation

**Correct Answer**: B

**Explanation**: Prioritization weighs scoring, urgency, benefit delays, and timing (Lesson 2, Page 33). A is partial, C is false, and D is scope (Lesson 5).

---

### Q22: A project with high strategic alignment but longer payback period might be prioritized using:

- **A)** Payback Period alone
- **B)** Sensitivity analysis in a scoring model
- **C)** NPV only
- **D)** Ignoring tradeoffs

**Correct Answer**: B

**Explanation**: Sensitivity analysis adjusts scoring models for strategy over pure financials (Lesson 2, Pages 31-32). A and C favor financial, D is poor practice.

---

### Q23: Flow-down objectives ensure strategic objectives are implemented through:

- **A)** Operations and projects
- **B)** Financial models only
- **C)** Subprojects exclusively
- **D)** Stakeholder registers

**Correct Answer**: A

**Explanation**: Flow-down links strategic objectives to operations and projects (Lesson 2, Page 12). B is selection, C is partial, and D is stakeholders (Lesson 4).

---

**Explanation**: Portfolio management evaluates resources, organizational, and individual capabilities (Lesson 2, Page 13). B is SWOT, C is scheduling (Lesson 6), and D is scope (Lesson 5).

---

### Q25: A strength of using a scoring model for prioritization is:

- **A)** It guarantees perfect objectivity
- **B)** It allows for sensitivity to changes in criteria
- **C)** It focuses solely on cost
- **D)** It eliminates the need for stakeholder input

**Correct Answer**: B

**Explanation**: Scoring models enable sensitivity analysis for factor changes (Lesson 2, Page 31). A is false (subjective), C is financial, and D is untrue (stakeholders involved).
