### **Answers and Explanations**

1. **B) A temporary endeavor to create a unique product, service, or result**  
   - **Explanation**: PMBOK defines a project as temporary (defined start/end) and unique (distinct output). A is incorrect (projects aren’t permanent), C is operations, D lacks uniqueness/end date (Lesson 1, Page 3).

2. **C) Controlling**  
   - **Explanation**: The five PMBOK process groups are Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing. “Controlling” alone isn’t a group; it’s part of “Monitoring and Controlling” (Lesson 1, Page 15).

3. **B) Unity of command with one clear supervisor**  
   - **Explanation**: Functional organizations have clear lines of authority with one supervisor per employee, reducing confusion. A is a disadvantage (slow communication), C is more matrix/projectized, D is irrelevant (Lesson 1, Page 39).

4. **C) Functional**  
   - **Explanation**: In functional organizations, project managers lack authority, and team members report to functional managers, causing prioritization issues. Projectized (A) gives PM full authority, Matrix (B) shares it, Hybrid isn’t specified (Lesson 1, Page 40).

5. **B) Time Management**  
   - **Explanation**: Time Management includes processes for timely project completion (e.g., scheduling). Scope defines work, Cost handles budgets, Quality ensures requirements are met (Lesson 1, Page 16).

6. **C) Uncontrolled scope creep**  
   - **Explanation**: Scope creep (uncontrolled expansion) is a common failure cause. A, B, and D are success factors (Lesson 1, Page 26).

7. **B) Chartering the project and mentoring the project manager**  
   - **Explanation**: Sponsors charter projects and mentor PMs. A is team tasks, C is functional manager’s role, D is PM’s responsibility (Lesson 1, Page 29).

8. **B) Project Manager**  
   - **Explanation**: In projectized organizations, the PM has full authority over budgets/personnel. Functional Managers (A) control functional orgs, Steering Team (C) prioritizes, Customer Rep (D) defines requirements (Lesson 1, Page 41).

9. **B) Planning**  
   - **Explanation**: Planning involves establishing scope and refining objectives. Initiating authorizes, Executing performs work, Closing finalizes (Lesson 1, Page 15).

10. **B) Stakeholder expectation management**  
    - **Explanation**: Disagreements on deliverables stem from unclear stakeholder expectations. A, C, D don’t directly address stakeholder alignment (Lesson 1, Page 26).
